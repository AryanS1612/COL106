	# The aim is to choose a N such that, x[i...i+m-1] is not equal to p then Pr(i belongs to L) <= eps.
	# Let us consider the equality(or matching) of strings soleley in terms of f(x[i...i+m-1]) = f(p).
	# Thus in a more mathematical way, what we need to do is, Pr(f(x[i...i+m-1])modulo q = f(p)modulo q|f(x[i...i+m-1]) != f(p)) <= eps.
	# The above expression is equivalent to Pr(q divides (f(x[i...i+m-1]) - f(p))| f(x[i...i+m-1]) != f(p)) <= eps.
	# We aim at bounding the expression Pr(q divides (f(x[i...i+m-1]) - f(p))| f(x[i...i+m-1]) != f(p)) by an expression in terms of N and m
	# Now, we get a random prime less than N from the fucntion randPrime(N), this means that the above expression of Probability can be 
	# simplified using the fact that number of prime factors of (f(x[i...i+m-1]) - f(p)) are log(f(x[i...i+m-1]) - f(p)) and we have a 
	# random distribution of primes less than N from findPrime(N), thus probability that the prime from randPrime(N) is a factor of 
	# (f(x[i...i+m-1]) - f(p)) is log(f(x[i...i+m-1]) - f(p))/pi(N), the maximum possible difference f(x[i...i+m-1]) - f(p) can be 26^m - 1.
	# thus Pr(q divides (f(x[i...i+m-1]) - f(p))| f(x[i...i+m-1]) != f(p)) <= mlog(26)/pi(N). We know pi(N) > N/2logN, thus, 
	# Pr(q divides (f(x[i...i+m-1]) - f(p))| f(x[i...i+m-1]) != f(p)) <= mlog(26)/(N/2logN) <= eps. Thus, 2mlog(26)/eps <= N/logN.
	# Now let 2mlog(26)/eps = k, we approximate N to be aklogk(more tighter may exist, this is just a sensible guess(as k*k is quite big)),
	# k <= aklog(k)/(loga + logk + log(logk)) implies, loga + log(logk) <= (a-1)logk,By plotting this on a graphing calculator and varying a,
